# Simplified Relay Strategy

## Problem Analysis

The current approach is too complicated because I'm trying to handle relay in multiple places:
1. Force finalization (response.created)
2. Completion event handler
3. handleUserTranscript

This creates race conditions and complexity.

## Root Cause

Looking at the user's logs, the completion event ALWAYS has:
- ‚úÖ Full transcript text
- ‚úÖ item_id
- ‚úÖ Arrives reliably

So why try to relay from multiple places?

## Simplified Solution

**ONLY relay from the transcription completion event handler.**

### Logic:
```typescript
if (type.includes('input_audio_transcription.completed')) {
  const transcript = extract_transcript(payload)
  const itemId = payload.item_id
  
  // Only relay if we haven't relayed this item_id yet
  if (this.backendTranscriptMode && itemId && this.lastRelayedItemId !== itemId && transcript.length > 0) {
    console.log('üì° Relaying transcript:', transcript.slice(0,50), 'item_id:', itemId)
    this.relayTranscriptToBackend('user', transcript, true, Date.now(), itemId)
    this.lastRelayedItemId = itemId
  }
  
  // Continue with normal finalization logic...
}
```

### Benefits:
- ‚úÖ Single point of relay (easier to debug)
- ‚úÖ Always has item_id available
- ‚úÖ Always has full transcript text
- ‚úÖ Simple deduplication via item_id check
- ‚úÖ No race conditions

### What about force finalization?

Force finalization is ONLY for the transcriptEngine's internal state. It doesn't need to relay because:
1. Completion event will arrive shortly after with the SAME text
2. Completion event has the item_id we need
3. Item_id check prevents duplicate relay

### Edge Case: What if completion never arrives?

Then the transcript won't be relayed. But this is OK because:
- If completion doesn't arrive, we don't have the official transcript anyway
- Force finalization uses buffered deltas which may be incomplete
- Better to miss one transcript than send duplicates

## Implementation

Remove all relay logic from:
- ‚ùå handleUserTranscript
- ‚ùå Force finalization (response.created)

Keep ONLY in:
- ‚úÖ Transcription completion event handler

This matches the "wait for official transcript" philosophy.
