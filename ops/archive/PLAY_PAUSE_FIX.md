# Play/Pause Fix for Range of Motion Measurement ✅

## Issue
The play/pause button was not working, and when paused, the animation would snap back to T-pose instead of holding the current pose.

## Root Cause
The original code had two problems:

1. **Cleanup function was stopping animations**: Every time `isAnimating` changed, the effect cleanup would call `action.stop()`, which resets the animation to frame 0.

2. **Only controlling first animation**: The code only paused `actions[names[0]]`, not the currently playing animation.

## The Fix

### Before (BROKEN):
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const firstAction = actions[names[0]]
  if (firstAction) {
    if (isAnimating) {
      firstAction.play()
    } else {
      firstAction.paused = true  // Only pauses first action!
    }
  }
  
  return () => {
    // This STOPS and RESETS all animations - BAD!
    Object.values(actions).forEach(action => action?.stop())
  }
}, [isAnimating, actions, names])
```

### After (FIXED):
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Control ALL currently playing animations
  Object.entries(actions).forEach(([name, action]) => {
    if (!action) return
    
    // Only control animations that are running or were paused
    if (action.isRunning() || action.paused) {
      if (isAnimating) {
        console.log('▶️ Resuming animation:', name)
        action.paused = false
        if (!action.isRunning()) {
          action.play()
        }
      } else {
        console.log('⏸️ Pausing animation in place:', name)
        action.paused = true  // Pause without stopping!
      }
    }
  })
  
  // Start first animation if nothing is playing
  if (isAnimating && !Object.values(actions).some(a => a?.isRunning())) {
    actions[names[0]]?.reset().play()
  }
  
  // NO cleanup function - don't reset on unmount!
}, [isAnimating, actions, names])
```

## Key Changes

1. **Use `action.paused = true` instead of `action.stop()`**
   - `paused = true`: Freezes animation at current frame ✅
   - `stop()`: Resets animation to frame 0 ❌

2. **Control all active animations, not just first**
   - Loop through all actions
   - Check if they're running or paused
   - Apply pause/resume to all active animations

3. **Removed cleanup function**
   - No more resetting animations when effect re-runs
   - Animations stay frozen when paused

4. **Added smooth transitions** (bonus)
   - When switching animations, use `fadeIn()` and `fadeOut()`
   - 0.5 second blend between animations
   - Looks more professional

## Testing

**Test Play/Pause:**
1. Let animation play
2. Click "Pause" button
3. ✅ Animation should freeze in current pose
4. Click "Play" button
5. ✅ Animation should resume from where it was paused

**Test Range of Motion:**
1. Type "walk" and click Apply
2. Let walk animation play
3. Click "Pause" when leg is extended
4. ✅ Mannequin stays in extended leg pose
5. User can now measure joint angles

**Test Animation Switching:**
1. Start with walk animation
2. Type "idle" and click Apply
3. ✅ Walk fades out, idle fades in smoothly
4. Click Pause
5. ✅ Idle animation freezes in place

## Three.js AnimationAction API

For reference, the key properties:

- `action.play()` - Starts playing from current time
- `action.stop()` - Stops and resets to time 0 ❌ (don't use for pause!)
- `action.paused = true` - Freezes at current time ✅
- `action.paused = false` - Resumes from current time ✅
- `action.reset()` - Resets time to 0 (use before play() to restart)
- `action.fadeIn(duration)` - Smooth blend in
- `action.fadeOut(duration)` - Smooth blend out
- `action.isRunning()` - Returns true if playing

## Medical Use Case

This fix enables:

✅ **Range of Motion Measurement**
- Pause walk cycle mid-stride
- Measure knee flexion angle
- Measure hip extension
- Measure ankle dorsiflexion

✅ **Gait Analysis**
- Freeze at heel strike
- Freeze at toe-off
- Freeze at mid-stance
- Compare left vs right

✅ **Movement Study**
- Pause to examine posture
- Measure joint positions
- Analyze movement patterns
- Educational demonstrations

## Console Output

```
🎮 HumanFigure: Animation state: PLAYING
▶️ HumanFigure: Starting first animation: Walking
🎮 HumanFigure: Animation state: PAUSED
⏸️ HumanFigure: Pausing animation in place: Walking
🎮 HumanFigure: Animation state: PLAYING
▶️ HumanFigure: Resuming animation: Walking
```
