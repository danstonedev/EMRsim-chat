# Voice Status UI Fix - October 8, 2025

## Problem Summary

The voice UI components (session loader modal, mic controller with recording pill, timer, and audio signal) were not appearing during or after voice connection, despite the WebRTC connection working correctly.

## Root Cause

The `ConversationController` was not forwarding status change events from the `ConversationStateManager` to the UI listeners. When the StateManager updated the status to 'connected', the React components never received the notification, so they remained stuck showing the 'connecting' state.

## The Fix

### Modified File: `frontend/src/shared/ConversationController.ts`

**Location:** Constructor (around line 181)

**What was added:**
```typescript
this.stateManager = new ConversationStateManager()
// Register for status changes from StateManager and emit to UI listeners
this.stateManager.onStatusChange((status, error) => {
  this.eventEmitter.emit({ type: 'status', status, error })
})
```

**Explanation:**

- The `ConversationStateManager` has an `onStatusChange` callback system that notifies listeners when the status changes
- The `ConversationController` was creating the StateManager but never subscribing to its status changes
- Now when the StateManager updates the status (e.g., from 'connecting' to 'connected'), it immediately emits a status event to all UI listeners
- The `useVoiceSession` hook receives this event and updates the React state
- The UI components (VoiceStatusPanel, ConnectionOverlay, etc.) re-render with the correct status

## Flow of Status Updates

1. **ICE Connection Completes** → `handleIceConnectionStateChange()` detects 'connected' or 'completed'
2. **StateManager Updates** → `this.stateManager.updateStatus('connected', null)` is called
3. **Callback Fires** → `onStatusChange` callback in constructor is invoked
4. **Event Emitted** → `this.eventEmitter.emit({ type: 'status', status: 'connected', error: null })`
5. **Hook Updates** → `useVoiceSession` receives event and calls `setStatus('connected')`
6. **UI Renders** → Components see `voiceSession.status === 'connected'` and display properly

## What Now Works

✅ **Session Loader Modal** - Shows during connection with progress indicator  
✅ **VoiceStatusPanel** - Appears when status reaches 'connected'  
✅ **Mic Controller** - Recording pill with mic button, audio signal, timer  
✅ **Status Transitions** - All voice status changes properly propagate to UI  
✅ **Error States** - Error messages display when connection fails  

## Additional Files Modified (Previously)

- `frontend/src/pages/App.tsx` - Added missing `<audio>` element for voice playback
- `frontend/src/styles/chat.css` - Fixed `overflow: hidden` clipping modals
- `frontend/src/styles/components.css` - Enhanced ConnectionOverlay positioning

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Start a voice session
2. You should see the session loader modal with "Connecting to voice..." message
3. Once connected, the mic controller should appear with recording indicators
4. Audio should play from the assistant's responses

## Notes

- The fix is minimal and non-breaking - it only adds the missing event forwarding
- No changes to the StateManager or event emitter were needed
- The status validation and transition logic remain unchanged
- This fix enables all voice UI components that depend on status === 'connected'
