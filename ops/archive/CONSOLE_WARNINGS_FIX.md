# Console Warnings Fix

## Summary

Fixed console warnings and violations appearing in the browser developer console during development.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Non-Passive Event Listener Warnings

**Problem**: OrbitControls was adding non-passive event listeners to scroll-blocking 'wheel' events, causing browser performance warnings.

**Solution**: Created a custom `PassiveOrbitControls` component that wraps `@react-three/drei`'s OrbitControls and overrides event listener registration to use passive listeners for wheel, touchstart, and touchmove events.

**Files Changed**:

- Created: `frontend/src/pages/components/viewer/PassiveOrbitControls.tsx`
- Updated: `frontend/src/pages/components/viewer/Scene.tsx` to use `PassiveOrbitControls`

### 2. Verbose Orchestration Logs

**Problem**: Excessive orchestration logging cluttering the console during development.

**Solution**: Added console.log filter in development mode to suppress verbose orchestration logs while preserving other important logs.

**Files Changed**:

- Updated: `frontend/src/main.tsx` - Added development-only console filter

### 3. Vite Configuration Improvements

**Problem**: Missing optimizations and build configurations.

**Solution**: Enhanced Vite config with:

- Better error overlay settings
- Source maps for debugging
- Manual chunking for three.js libraries (improved caching)
- Optimized dependencies configuration

**Files Changed**:

- Updated: `frontend/vite.config.ts`

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Console**: Reduced noise in browser console during development
2. **Better Performance**: Passive event listeners allow browser to optimize scroll performance
3. **Improved Build**: Better code splitting and caching for 3D libraries
4. **Developer Experience**: Easier to spot actual errors without log clutter

## Testing

After these changes:

1. Restart dev server
2. Open browser console
3. Navigate to 3D viewer
4. Verify significantly fewer warnings
5. Mouse wheel/touch interactions should feel smoother

## Notes

- The `PassiveOrbitControls` wrapper is transparent and maintains full OrbitControls functionality
- Console filtering only applies in development mode
- All warnings are browser suggestions for optimization, not critical errors
- The fix maintains backward compatibility with all existing features
