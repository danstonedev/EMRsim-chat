# âœ… Mixamo Integration - Phase 1 Complete!

## What Just Happened

Your T-Pose character is now integrated! The code has been updated to load the professional Mixamo GLB model instead of the basic geometric figure.

### Files Updated

- âœ… `frontend/src/pages/components/viewer/HumanFigure.tsx` - Now uses `useGLTF` to load your model
- âœ… `frontend/src/pages/components/viewer/Scene.tsx` - Added Suspense wrapper for async loading
- âœ… `frontend/public/models/human-figure.glb` - Your T-Pose character (30MB)

### Test It Now!

**Your 3D viewer is running at: http://localhost:5174/3d-viewer**

Open that URL and you should see your Mixamo character in T-pose!

## Next Steps: Add Animations

Now that the character is working, let's add animations!

### Step 1: Download Animations from Mixamo

Go back to [mixamo.com](https://www.mixamo.com/) and download these 5 animations:

**FOR EACH ANIMATION:**

1. **Keep your T-Pose character selected** (don't change it)
2. Click on "Animations" tab
3. Search for the animation name below
4. **IMPORTANT**: Before downloading, check "In Place" option
5. Download as FBX (or GLB if available)
6. Save each with the name below:

**Recommended Animations:**

- `idle.glb` - Standing still, subtle breathing
- `walking.glb` - Normal walking pace
- `running.glb` - Fast run
- `sitting.glb` - Sitting down
- `waving.glb` - Friendly wave

### Step 2: Convert FBX to GLB (if needed)

If you downloaded FBX files, convert them using:

- Online: https://products.aspose.app/3d/conversion/fbx-to-glb
- OR use Blender (File â†’ Export â†’ glTF 2.0)

### Step 3: Copy Animation Files to Project

Once you have all 5 GLB files, let me know and I'll help you:

1. Copy them to `frontend/public/models/animations/`
2. Update the code to load and play animations
3. Add animation selector UI

## Quick Command Reference

**Stop dev server:** Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

**Restart dev server:**
```powershell
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Check if model file exists:**
```powershell
Get-Item frontend\public\models\human-figure.glb
```

---

## What's Possible Next

Once animations are integrated, you can:

- Click buttons to switch between animations
- Combine multiple animations (walk + wave)
- Add custom camera angles
- Add medical overlays (bones, muscles, organs)
- Create animation sequences
- Export rendered views

---

## Need Help?

Just say:

- "Ready to add animations" - When you have the 5 GLB files downloaded
- "Test the model" - To debug if something isn't showing correctly
- "Change the scale" - If the model is too big/small
- "Add lighting" - To improve the visual quality

**You're making great progress! ðŸŽ‰**
