# Audio Playback and Media Preview Fixes

**Date:** 2025-10-08

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Audio Playback Not Working
**Problem:** Voice audio from OpenAI Realtime API wasn't playing despite successful WebRTC connection.

**Root Cause:** The `AudioStreamManager` wasn't receiving the audio element reference. When `ConversationController.attachRemoteAudioElement()` was called, it wasn't forwarding the element to `audioManager`.

**Solution:**
- Modified `ConversationController.attachRemoteAudioElement()` to call `this.audioManager.attachRemoteAudioElement(element)`
- File: `frontend/src/shared/ConversationController.ts` line 559

### 2. Media Previews Not Showing in Chat
**Problem:** When AI included `[MEDIA:media_id]` markers in responses, the media preview thumbnails weren't appearing in chat messages.

**Root Cause:** Two issues:
1. Media was loading asynchronously after voice session started, so initial `setScenarioMedia` was called with empty array
2. `ConversationController.setScenarioMedia()` wasn't updating the `TranscriptCoordinator` when media changed

**Solution:**
- Modified `setScenarioMedia()` to call `this.transcriptCoordinator.setScenarioMedia(this.scenarioMedia)`
- File: `frontend/src/shared/ConversationController.ts` line 493-495

### 3. Noisy Console Logs
**Problem:** Repetitive `[voice] status: connected` logs flooding the console on every render.

**Solution:**
- Removed debug log from component body that was running on every render
- File: `frontend/src/pages/App.tsx` removed lines 351-358

## Technical Details

### Audio Element Flow
1. `ChatView.tsx` creates audio element with ref: `voiceSession.remoteAudioRef`
2. `useVoiceSession` defines custom ref with getter/setter
3. Setter calls `controller.attachRemoteAudioElement(value)`
4. Controller forwards to both:
   - `this.remoteAudioElement = element` (for WebRTC setup)
   - `this.audioManager.attachRemoteAudioElement(element)` (for playback)

### Media Loading Flow
1. `useScenarioMedia` hook fetches scenario from backend
2. Extracts `media_library` array and maps to `MediaReference[]`
3. Passes to `useVoiceSession` as `scenarioMedia` prop
4. `useVoiceSession` calls `controller.setScenarioMedia(media)`
5. Controller updates both:
   - `this.scenarioMedia = media`
   - `this.transcriptCoordinator.setScenarioMedia(media)`
6. When AI includes `[MEDIA:id]`, TranscriptCoordinator parses and attaches to message
7. `MessageItem` component renders preview if `message.media` exists

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/shared/ConversationController.ts`
   - Added audio element forwarding in `attachRemoteAudioElement()`
   - Added transcript coordinator update in `setScenarioMedia()`

2. `frontend/src/pages/App.tsx`
   - Removed repetitive debug log from component body

3. `frontend/src/shared/hooks/useScenarioMedia.ts`
   - Added debug logging for media loading (can be removed later)

4. `frontend/src/shared/useVoiceSession.ts`
   - Added debug logging for media setting (can be removed later)

5. `frontend/src/pages/components/chat/MessageItem.tsx`
   - Added debug logging for media rendering (can be removed later)

6. `frontend/src/shared/transport/RealtimeTransport.ts`
   - Added debug logging for WebRTC track events (can be removed later)

## Testing

✅ Audio playback works - AI voice responses play through speakers
✅ Media previews appear - thumbnails show up in assistant messages when AI includes `[MEDIA:id]`
✅ Media modal opens - clicking preview opens full-size modal
✅ Console logs are clean - no repetitive status logs

## Cleanup Recommendations

Consider removing or commenting out debug logs added during troubleshooting:
- `[useScenarioMedia] Fetching scenario:` logs
- `[useVoiceSession] Setting scenario media:` logs
- `[MessageItem] Message has media:` logs
- `[RealtimeTransport] track event received` logs
- `[AudioStreamManager] handleRemoteStream called` logs

These were helpful for debugging but may not be needed in production.
