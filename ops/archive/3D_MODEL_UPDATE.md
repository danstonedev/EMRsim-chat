# 3D Model Update - Manny Character

**Date:** October 10, 2025

## Changes Made

### Model Replacement

- **Old Model:** `human-figure.glb` (1.28 MB) - had broken texture references
- **New Model:** `manny.glb` (38.6 MB) - Mixamo Manny character with embedded textures
- **Backup:** Old model saved as `human-figure.glb.backup`

### Code Cleanup

#### HumanFigure.tsx

- ✅ Removed texture fallback workaround for missing Mixamo textures
- ✅ Removed material override - now uses model's original materials
- ✅ Kept shadow casting configuration
- ✅ Updated documentation comments

#### useHumanFigure.ts

- ✅ Removed material override
- ✅ Kept shadow casting configuration
- ✅ Preserved normalization and scaling logic

## Benefits

1. **No More Console Errors:** The new model has proper embedded textures
2. **Better Visual Quality:** Model uses its original materials and textures
3. **Ready for Animation:** Clean foundation for adding animations

## File Locations

```plaintext
frontend/public/models/
├── human-figure.glb         ← New Manny model (38.6 MB)
└── human-figure.glb.backup  ← Old model backup (1.28 MB)
```

## Next Steps

- Add animation support to HumanFigure component
- Load and test Mixamo animations with the new model
- Optimize if file size becomes an issue in production
