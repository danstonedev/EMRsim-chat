# Animation Control Fix - Single Active Animation ‚úÖ

## The Real Problem (From Your Logs)

``` text
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Resuming animation: Standing
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Resuming animation: Walking
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Resuming animation: Jumping
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Resuming animation: Squatting
```

**ALL 4 animations were being controlled at once!**

When you clicked Pause:
``` text
‚è∏Ô∏è Pausing animation in place: Standing
‚è∏Ô∏è Pausing animation in place: Walking
‚è∏Ô∏è Pausing animation in place: Jumping
‚è∏Ô∏è Pausing animation in place: Squatting
```

## Root Cause

The play/pause logic was checking `action.getEffectiveWeight() > 0` for ALL animations, which meant:

- When page loads, all 4 animations are loaded into memory
- They all have some initial weight/state
- The loop tried to resume/pause ALL of them
- Result: Multiple animations playing simultaneously = weird blended movement

## The Solution

**Track which animation is currently active** using a ref:

```typescript
const currentAnimationRef = useRef<string | null>(null)
```

### Before (BROKEN)

```typescript
// Control ALL animations that have any weight
Object.entries(actions).forEach(([name, action]) => {
  const isActive = action.getEffectiveWeight() > 0
  
  if (isActive || action.isRunning() || action.paused) {
    if (isAnimating) {
      console.log('‚ñ∂Ô∏è Resuming animation:', name)  // ALL 4 ANIMATIONS!
      action.play()
    } else {
      console.log('‚è∏Ô∏è Pausing animation:', name)   // ALL 4 ANIMATIONS!
      action.paused = true
    }
  }
})
```

### After (FIXED)

```typescript
// Only control the current animation
const currentAnim = currentAnimationRef.current

if (currentAnim && actions[currentAnim]) {
  const action = actions[currentAnim]
  
  if (isAnimating) {
    console.log('‚ñ∂Ô∏è Resuming animation:', currentAnim)  // ONLY ONE!
    action.paused = false
    if (!action.isRunning()) {
      action.play()
    }
  } else {
    console.log('‚è∏Ô∏è Pausing animation in place:', currentAnim)  // ONLY ONE!
    action.paused = true
  }
}

// Start Standing animation by default if no animation is set
if (isAnimating && !currentAnimationRef.current) {
  const defaultAnimation = 'Standing'
  const defaultAction = actions[defaultAnimation]
  
  if (defaultAction) {
    // Stop all other animations first
    Object.values(actions).forEach(a => a?.stop())
    
    // Play the default animation
    defaultAction.reset().play()
    currentAnimationRef.current = defaultAnimation  // TRACK IT!
  }
}
```

### When Switching Animations

```typescript
// User types "walk" and clicks Apply
if (matchedAnimation && actions[matchedAnimation]) {
  // Stop all other animations
  Object.entries(actions).forEach(([name, action]) => {
    if (name !== matchedAnimation && action) {
      action.stop()
    }
  })
  
  // Play the matched animation
  const targetAction = actions[matchedAnimation]
  if (targetAction) {
    targetAction.reset().play()
    currentAnimationRef.current = matchedAnimation  // UPDATE TRACKER!
  }
}
```

## Expected Console Output (After Fix)

**On page load:**
``` text
üé¨ HumanFigure: Found animations: ['Standing', 'Walking', 'Jumping', 'Squatting']
üéÆ HumanFigure: Animation state: PLAYING
‚ñ∂Ô∏è HumanFigure: Starting default animation: Standing
üìã Available animations: ['Standing', 'Walking', 'Jumping', 'Squatting']
```

**When you click Pause:**
``` text
üéÆ HumanFigure: Animation state: PAUSED
‚è∏Ô∏è HumanFigure: Pausing animation in place: Standing
```
(ONLY Standing - not all 4!)

**When you click Play:**
``` text
üéÆ HumanFigure: Animation state: PLAYING
‚ñ∂Ô∏è HumanFigure: Resuming animation: Standing
```
(ONLY Standing - not all 4!)

**When you type "walk" and Apply:**
``` text
‚úÖ HumanFigure: Switching to animation: Walking
```

**Then pause mid-walk:**
``` text
üéÆ HumanFigure: Animation state: PAUSED
‚è∏Ô∏è HumanFigure: Pausing animation in place: Walking
```
(ONLY Walking!)

## Key Changes

1. **Added `currentAnimationRef`** - Tracks which animation is active
2. **Only control current animation** - Don't loop through all actions
3. **Update ref when starting** - Set `currentAnimationRef.current` when playing
4. **Update ref when switching** - Change ref when user applies new prompt
5. **Stop others explicitly** - When switching, stop all other animations first

## Why This Works

**The Problem with `getEffectiveWeight()`:**

- All loaded animations have some weight > 0 initially
- Checking weight catches ALL animations
- Loop tries to control all of them simultaneously

**The Solution with Ref Tracking:**

- Only ONE animation name stored in ref
- Only that ONE animation gets play/pause commands
- Others are explicitly stopped when not needed
- Clean single-animation control

## Testing Checklist

After refresh:

- [ ] Console shows: `‚ñ∂Ô∏è Starting default animation: Standing` (ONCE)
- [ ] Mannequin appears in standing pose
- [ ] Standing animation plays smoothly
- [ ] Click Pause ‚Üí Console shows `‚è∏Ô∏è Pausing animation in place: Standing` (ONCE)
- [ ] Mannequin freezes in standing pose (not T-pose!)
- [ ] Click Play ‚Üí Console shows `‚ñ∂Ô∏è Resuming animation: Standing` (ONCE)
- [ ] Type "walk" + Apply ‚Üí Console shows `‚úÖ Switching to animation: Walking`
- [ ] Mannequin walks
- [ ] Pause mid-walk ‚Üí Freezes with leg extended
- [ ] Play ‚Üí Resumes walking from that exact position
- [ ] Type "jump" + Apply ‚Üí Jumps
- [ ] Type "squat" + Apply ‚Üí Squats

## Medical Training Benefits

Now students can:

‚úÖ **Focus on ONE movement at a time**

- No confusing blended animations
- Clean, isolated movement patterns

‚úÖ **Pause and study joint positions**

- Freeze walk cycle mid-stride
- Measure knee flexion angle
- Examine hip extension

‚úÖ **Switch between movements**

- Compare standing vs squatting posture
- Analyze different gait patterns
- Study range of motion across activities

‚úÖ **Reliable play/pause behavior**

- Animation stays where you paused it
- Resume continues from exact position
- No sudden jumps or resets

This is now a proper animation player for medical education! üè•
