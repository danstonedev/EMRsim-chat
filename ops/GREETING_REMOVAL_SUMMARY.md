# Verbal Greeting Removal - October 5, 2025

## Summary

Successfully replaced the automatic AI verbal greeting with a simple visual toast notification. This eliminates complexity, improves UX, and makes the simulation more realistic.

---

## Problem Statement

The automatic verbal greeting system was causing multiple issues:

1. **Complex Logic**: Required special "finalize-empty" case handling in ConversationController
2. **Content Problems**: Had to carefully craft instructions to prevent AI from volunteering patient identity
3. **Timing Issues**: First message transcription could be incomplete or miss loading state updates
4. **Unrealistic**: Real patients don't typically greet clinicians first in medical settings
5. **Documentation Burden**: See `ops/INITIAL_GREETING_FIX.md` - significant effort to get it right

---

## Solution: Visual "Voice Ready" Notification

Replaced verbal greeting with a clean pop-up toast that appears when voice connection is established.

### What Changed

#### 1. Backend Instructions (backend/src/sps/core/instructions.ts)

**Before:**
```
**Initial greeting**: When the connection is established and you're ready to begin, 
greet the student with a brief, friendly introduction to confirm you're connected 
and ready. Keep it natural and conversational. Examples:
- "Hello, I'm ready whenever you are."
- "Hi there."
```

**After:**
```
**Wait for the student to speak first**: The student will initiate the conversation. 
Do not greet or speak until the student addresses you. Once they speak, respond 
naturally as a patient would.
```

#### 2. Frontend Event System

**Added new event type** to `ConversationController.ts`:
```typescript
export type ConversationEvent =
  | { type: 'voice-ready' }  // ‚Üê NEW
  | { type: 'status'; status: VoiceStatus; error: string | null }
  | ...
```

**Emits when connection is ready** (line ~1262):
```typescript
if (!this.fullyReady) {
  this.fullyReady = true
  this.emit({ type: 'connection-progress', step: 'complete', progress: 100 })
  this.emit({ type: 'voice-ready' })  // ‚Üê NEW
}
```

#### 3. UI Components

Created `VoiceReadyToast.tsx`:
- Shows: "üé§ Voice Ready - You can start speaking now"
- Auto-dismisses after 3 seconds
- Dismisses immediately when user starts speaking
- Beautiful gradient purple design
- Positioned at top center of screen

#### 4. Integration in App.tsx

- Listens for `voice-ready` event
- Shows toast when connection established
- Dismisses toast on first user transcript (in `handleUserTranscript`)

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Simpler Architecture**: Removed "finalize-empty" edge case handling  
‚úÖ **Better UX**: Visual confirmation is clearer than audio  
‚úÖ **Faster Connection**: No delay waiting for AI to generate greeting  
‚úÖ **More Realistic**: Matches actual clinical interactions  
‚úÖ **Less Code**: Eliminated greeting instruction complexity  
‚úÖ **Fewer Edge Cases**: No transcription timing issues with first message  

---

## Testing

### Automated Tests

All existing tests pass without modification:
- Tests already expected user-speaks-first pattern
- No AI-first greeting dependencies found

### Manual Testing

**Test Steps:**
1. Select persona and scenario
2. Click "Start Voice"
3. **Verify:** Purple "Voice Ready" toast appears at top
4. **Verify:** Toast auto-dismisses after 3 seconds (if you don't speak)
5. **OR:** Start speaking and verify toast dismisses immediately
6. **Verify:** AI does NOT speak first - waits for user

**Expected Behavior:**
- Connection progress indicator shows during setup
- Toast appears when connection completes
- AI remains silent until user speaks
- User initiates conversation naturally

---

## Migration Notes

### For Developers

- The `voice-ready` event is now available for other UI components to use
- Toast can be customized via `voice-ready-toast.css`
- Auto-dismiss timing is configurable in `VoiceReadyToast.tsx` (currently 3s)

### For Instructors

- Students will see visual confirmation when voice is ready
- No change to learning objectives - students still initiate patient interviews
- More realistic simulation of clinical scenarios

## Rollback

If needed, revert these commits:
```bash
git log --oneline --grep="greeting" -5
# Find the commit hash, then:
git revert <commit-hash>
```

Or manually restore old greeting instructions from git history.

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to voice-ready notification:

1. **Sound effect**: Add subtle "connection ready" chime
2. **Customizable message**: Allow scenarios to define custom ready message
3. **Accessibility**: Add screen reader announcement
4. **Multiple languages**: Localize toast message based on session language
5. **Connection quality indicator**: Show signal strength in toast
