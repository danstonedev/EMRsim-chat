# Testing the Transcription Fix

## What Was Fixed

We fixed the **root cause** of transcription failures and no voice responses:

- Previously: Finalized user messages BEFORE transcription completed
- Now: Wait for `conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed` event
- Added: Explicit audio modalities to session config

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Application

Frontend and backend should both be running (tasks should already be active).

### 2. Start a Voice Session

1. Click the microphone button to start voice
2. Wait for connection to complete
3. Check console for these logs:

``` text
   [ConversationController] üéØ session.created received, enabling transcription
   [ConversationController] ‚úÖ session.update sent successfully
   [ConversationController] üéâ session.updated received from server
   ```

### 3. Speak Into Microphone

Say something clear like: **"Hello, this is a test of the speech transcription system."**

### 4. Verify Transcription

**In Console**, look for:
``` text
[ConversationController] Audio buffer committed, waiting for transcription...
[ConversationController] ‚úÖ TRANSCRIPTION COMPLETED: {transcript: "Hello, this is a test of the speech transcription system."}
```

**In UI**, verify:

- Your message appears with your ACTUAL WORDS
- NOT the fallback text "[Speech not transcribed]"

### 5. Verify Voice Response

**Check that**:

- Assistant responds to your message
- You HEAR the assistant speaking (audio playback works)
- Assistant's transcript appears in the UI

### 6. Test Multiple Turns

- Continue the conversation for 2-3 more turns
- Each turn should transcribe correctly
- Each response should play audio

## Expected Results

‚úÖ **SUCCESS**: All transcripts show actual speech, no fallback text
‚úÖ **SUCCESS**: Assistant responds with voice audio
‚úÖ **SUCCESS**: Multiple conversation turns work smoothly

‚ùå **FAILURE**: If you still see "[Speech not transcribed]"
‚ùå **FAILURE**: If you don't hear assistant speaking

## Console Logs Reference

### Successful Transcription

``` text
[ConversationController] üéØ session.created received, enabling transcription
[ConversationController] üì§ Sending session.update: {...}
[ConversationController] ‚úÖ session.update sent successfully
[ConversationController] üéâ session.updated received from server: {...}
[ConversationController] Audio buffer committed, waiting for transcription...
[ConversationController] ‚úÖ TRANSCRIPTION COMPLETED: {transcript: "actual words here"}
```

### If Transcription Fails (Rare)

``` text
[ConversationController] ‚ö†Ô∏è TRANSCRIPTION FAILED EVENT: {...}
```
(In this case, fallback text IS expected)

## Quick Smoke Test

**60 Second Test:**

1. Start voice (15 sec)
2. Say "Hello" (5 sec)
3. Verify transcript shows "Hello" (5 sec)
4. Verify assistant speaks back (10 sec)
5. Say "Thank you" (5 sec)
6. Verify second transcript works (5 sec)
7. Verify second response plays (15 sec)

**Pass Criteria:** Both transcripts show actual words + both responses have audio

## Troubleshooting

**If transcription still fails:**

- Check browser console for errors
- Check backend logs for issues
- Verify microphone permissions granted
- Try different browser (Chrome/Edge recommended)
- Check `session.updated` payload contains `input_audio_transcription: {model: 'whisper-1'}`

**If no audio response:**

- Check browser console for audio element errors
- Verify WebRTC track events in console
- Check if audio element is muted
- Try different audio output device

## Technical Changes

**File Modified:** `frontend/src/shared/ConversationController.ts`

**Key Changes:**

1. Line ~1280-1315: Refactored transcription event handling
2. Line ~1230-1245: Added modalities to session.update (session.created)
3. Line ~1675-1690: Added modalities to session.update (channel.open)

**What Was Removed:**

- Premature finalization on `input_audio_buffer.committed`
- Timeout-based finalization with empty payload
- `estimateSpeechCadence()` method (dead code)

**What Was Added:**

- Wait for `conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed`
- Extract transcript from event payload: `payload.transcript || payload.text`
- Explicit `modalities: ['text', 'audio']` in session config
