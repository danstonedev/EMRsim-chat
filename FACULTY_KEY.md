# Faculty Key: Snapshot + Narrative SOAP

Last Updated: October 23, 2025

The Faculty Key is a concise, printable page designed for instructors. It prioritizes Subjective and Objective (S/O) information that drives novice-friendly differentials, with the Plan collapsed by default.

## How to open

- From the app, click the "Faculty Key" button in the end-of-encounter actions.
- A new tab opens with a printable page and a Print button.

## What you’ll see

- Case Snapshot: scenario title/ID, region, setting, difficulty, patient info, working diagnosis.
- Subjective
  - Summary list (onset, duration, pain, dominant symptoms, aggravators/easers, 24h pattern, goals)
  - Grouped catalog by common history buckets: Pain/HPI, Red flags, Function & SDOH, PMH/PSH/Medications/Allergies, Prior imaging/treatment, Systems review, Goals
  - Coverage counts per bucket
- Objective
  - Grouped by exam categories: Observation & palpation, Functional movement, ROM, Strength, Joint mobility, Balance, Neurological, Special tests
  - Each item shows region, brief instructions, expected qualitative and numeric values, flags, guardrails, key pre/contra-indications
  - Coverage counts per category
- Assessment (working diagnosis + differentials)
- Plan (collapsed by default)
- Teaching points (if available)

## Authoring expectations (S/O-centric)

To keep the experience novice-friendly, scenarios should include:

- Subjective buckets with at least 1 entry each:
  - Pain/HPI, Red flags, Function & SDOH, PMH/PSH/Medications/Allergies, Systems review, Goals
  - Prior imaging/treatment encouraged when relevant
- Objective categories with at least 1 entry each:
  - Observation & palpation, Functional movement, ROM, Strength, Special tests
  - Neurological screen is required for spine regions (cervical/thoracic/lumbar)

The validator will warn when coverage is missing.

## Region must-haves (starter)

These help ensure novice-friendly differentials. Warnings appear when these are missing.

- Knee
  - ROM: flexion, extension
  - Strength: quadriceps, hamstrings (MMT)
  - Palpation: joint line and/or effusion
  - Functional: squat or step-down
  - Special tests: Lachman/anterior drawer (± pivot), valgus, varus, McMurray
- Shoulder
  - ROM: flexion, abduction
  - Strength: abduction/supraspinatus (MMT)
  - Special tests: Hawkins–Kennedy or Neer; Empty Can; Apprehension/Relocation

## Tips for authors

- Use concrete, realistic responses. Add 1–3 common qualitative responses per Subjective item.
- Prefer consistent naming for tests (use catalogs where available).
- For Objective, include expected numbers with units when relevant, and prominent yes/no flags.
- Use guardrails to model safety boundaries (deflection lines, data-only, refuse-if-contraindicated).
