  "primary_diagnosis": "Patellofemoral pain (right) — movement coordination deficits",
  "differential_diagnoses": [
    "Patellar tendinopathy (less likely: focal inferior pole tenderness absent; compression more provocative)",
    "Plica/fat pad irritation (pattern inconsistent)",
    "Meniscal irritation (unlikely: negative joint-line/mechanical tests)"
  ],
  "clinical_reasoning": [
    "Retropatellar/peripatellar ache reproduced by loaded flexion and stair descent.",
    "Dynamic knee valgus and pelvic drop on step-down; hip abd weakness (14% asymmetry).",
    "Lateral retinacular tightness; mild overpronation; ligament/meniscal screens negative."
  ],
  "prognosis": "Good with exercise-led, graded loading; expected improvement over 6–8 weeks with adherence."
