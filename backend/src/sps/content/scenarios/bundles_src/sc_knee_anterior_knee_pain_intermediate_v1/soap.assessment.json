  ],
  "clinical_impression": "28-year-old recreational runner presenting with gradual-onset anterior knee pain consistent with PFPS, exacerbated by increased training volume and hill running. Key positives: diffuse anterior/retropatellar pain, theater sign, pain with squatting/stairs, positive patellar compression tests, dynamic valgus, proximal weakness. Key negatives: no locking, no true instability, negative meniscal tests, stable patella. Proximal impairments (hip weakness, dynamic valgus) likely contributing to increased patellofemoral joint stress. Irritability moderate; prognosis good with appropriate load management and progressive strengthening.",
  "irritability_severity": "moderate",
  "staging_subgrouping": "patellofemoral pain with kinematic dysfunction",
  "prognosis": "good with 8-12 weeks of progressive rehabilitation",
  "icd10_codes": ["M22.2X1", "M25.561"],
  "differential_diagnoses_considered": [
    "patellar tendinopathy (less likely - no inferior pole tenderness, no pain with resisted extension)",
    "early chondromalacia patella (cannot rule out without imaging, but clinical presentation favors PFPS)",
    "meniscal injury (unlikely - negative Thessaly, negative McMurray, no joint line tenderness, no locking)",
    "plica syndrome (possible contributing factor but not primary driver)",
    "iliotibial band syndrome (lateral symptoms minimal, no lateral knee pain with running)"
