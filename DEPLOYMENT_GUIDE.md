## 📋 Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting any deployment:

- [ ] Azure subscription with Contributor access
- [ ] GitHub repository admin access
- [ ] Azure CLI installed: `az --version`
- [ ] Node.js 16+ installed: `node --version`
- [ ] Access to create service principals in Azure AD
- [ ] Understanding of your organization's change management process

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Environments
- **Staging:** Test environment identical to production
- **Production:** Live environment serving real users

### Deployment Strategy
- Uses **slot deployment** for zero-downtime deployments
- Implements **blue-green deployment** pattern
- Automatic **rollback** capability

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **CI (Continuous Integration):** Runs tests on every push
- **CD (Continuous Deployment):** Deploys to environments after approval

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Uses **Azure Bicep** templates
- All infrastructure is version-controlled
- Reproducible deployments

## 🚨 Important Warnings

1. **Never bypass CI checks** - They exist for a reason
2. **Always test in staging first** - Never deploy directly to production
3. **Verify secrets are correct** - Wrong credentials can cause data issues
4. **Have a rollback plan** - Know how to undo changes quickly
5. **Monitor after deployment** - First hour is critical
