Please save the bilateral knee X-ray image as `knee-xray.jpg` in this folder.

The image should show:
- Bilateral knee X-rays (AP and lateral views)
- No obvious bony abnormalities
- Preserved joint spaces

This will be displayed when students ask questions like:

- "Can I see the imaging?"
- "Do you have any radiographs?"
- "Show me the films"
